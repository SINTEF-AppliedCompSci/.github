# SINTEF Computational Geosciences

Welcome to the GitHub page for the [Computational Geosciences group at SINTEF Digital](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/departments-new/applied-mathematics/computational-geoscience/). For more details on us, please visit our webpage.

## Open Source Software
As a part of our contract research, we develop and maintain open source software. These are both developed by our group at SINTEF and in collaboration with industry, academia and other research institutions. Please see the respective webpages listed below for additional details.

| Software | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [![MRST](profile/img/mrst.png)](https://www.mrst.no) |   The **MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST)** is a free open-source software for reservoir modelling and simulation. The repositories for MRST are currently hosted at the [MRST bitbucket page](https://bitbucket.org/mrst/mrst-core/) with a self-contained mirror here at GitHub: [MRST on GitHub](https://www.github.com/sintef-comg/mrst). See also the MRST website found at [mrst.no](https://www.mrst.no). |
| [![OPM](profile/img/opm.png)](https://www.opm-project.org) | The **Open Porous Media (OPM)** initiative and the **OPM flow simulator** is hosted on the [OPM webpages](https://www.opm-project.org) and the [OPM GitHub site](https://github.com/opm). |
| [![BattMo](profile/img/battmo.png)](https://BatteryModel.com) | The **Battery Modelling Toolbox (BattMo)** is a resource for continuum modelling of electrochemical devices in MATLAB. BattMo builds upon the generic features of MRST and can be found at the [BattMo GitHub page](https://github.com/BattMoTeam/BattMo) and at [BatteryModel.com](https://BatteryModel.com). |
| [![JutulDarcy](profile/img/jutul.png)](https://github.com/sintefmath/JutulDarcy.jl) | **JutulDarcy.jl**, the Julia-based porous media simulator can be found at [the JutulDarcy.jl GitHub page](https://github.com/sintefmath/JutulDarcy.jl). The **Jutul.jl** simulation framework can be found at [the Jutul.jl GitHub page](https://github.com/sintefmath/Jutul.jl).|

## Contact
For technical queries specific to one of the above projects, we recommend posting an issue to the GitHub discussion page. For MRST in particular the e-mail address [mrst@sintef.no](mailto:mrst@sintef.no) can be used if you prefer private communication. For other queries, please contact [Knut-Andreas Lie, Chief Scientist](mailto:Knut-Andreas.Lie@sintef.no).
